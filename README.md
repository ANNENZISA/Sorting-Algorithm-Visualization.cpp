# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization.cpp
Creating a visual demonstration for sorting algorithms in a console-based program might be challenging. However, we can implement a text-based representation of the sorting process. This is an example using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
This program demonstrates the steps of the Bubble Sort algorithm by visually representing the array state at each step. The displayArray function is responsible for showing the array in the console, highlighting the current and sorted elements.
You can extend this example by implementing similar functions for other sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort, each with its unique visualization logic. Keep in mind that the visualization may vary based on the algorithm's characteristics.
